        <img src="./img/2.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The BJP stands for the promotion of all Indian languages and the accusation that it promotes Hindi at the
            cost of regional languages is “politically motivated”, Home Minister Amit Shah has said. In an exclusive
            interview with The Hindu, Mr. Shah said the party would win an absolute majority in Karnataka, where issues
            of regional identity have featured in a big way in the election campaign. “This is an important election for
            the BJP, and we will form the government with a full majority in Karnataka,” Mr. Shah said.</p>

        <img src="./img/3.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Budget airline Go First on Thursday extended flight cancellations until May 9 and informed the DGCA that it
            would not be taking any further bookings till May 15 on a day the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)
            reserved its judgment on the airline’s plea for insolvency proceedings and an interim moratorium on lessors
            re-possessing its planes.

            The airline’s CEO, Kaushik Khona, who was present at the NCLT hearing in Delhi told The Hindu that the total
            refunds for tickets booked directly through the airline amounted to “₹30-40 lakh”, in addition to which
            there were refunds for tickets bought through travel agents and web portals. Sales through intermediaries
            typically account for a much larger chunk, and could even be more than twice the direct sales. </p>

            The Indian Air Force has been undertaking continuous sorties from two airfields in Assam to keep a watch
            over Imphal and other violence-hit areas of Manipur.

            Late on May 4 night, the Manipur Government appointed Ashutosh Sinha, the Additional Director-General of
            Police (Intelligence) as the operational commander for controlling the simmering situation and ensuring
            peace in the State. </p>
